Tic-Tac-Toe Flet App
A modern, cross-platform Tic-Tac-Toe (X-O) game built with Python and the Flet framework. This app features a clean UI, support for local multiplayer, and an AI opponent.

 Features
Two Game Modes:

Player vs Player: Play locally with a friend.

Player vs AI: Challenge the computer (includes smart move logic).

Real-time Score Tracking: Keeps track of X wins, O wins, and draws during the session.

Responsive UI: Built with Flet containers and rows for a smooth visual experience.

Smart AI: The AI doesn't just play randomly; it tries to block your winning moves and complete its own.

Modern Design: Includes an AppBar, styled buttons, and clear status indicators.
